Solve each task using CouchDB:

Create a database music_artist
Import the data from MuseRelatedArtist.json file into the new database
Create a view that groups the information by the nb_album field and counts the number of rows per album.
Create another view that groups the information by the nb_album field and gets the total number of fans (nb_fan field) per album.
Replicate the database in a new one: music_artist_replica. Demonstrate that it works by adding a new artist in the original database and displaying it in the replica.


Upload a document (Word, PDF, PPT). For each task, show a screenshot/picture of each solved task.
